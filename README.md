# calrom

Command line utility providing access to the Roman Catholic
liturgical calendar (post-Vatican II).

## Installation

Coming soon.

## Project roadmap

`calrom` is in an early stage of development.
Goal is to provide a handy utility

* [ ] month/year overview - options and output mostly mimicking the
  the BSD Unix [`cal`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cal) utility,
  but with liturgical colours and celebration ranks
* [ ] detailed listing of a day/month/year/range of dates
* [ ] condensed format (but with detailed information) suitable for awesome/i3 toolbars etc.
* [ ] machine-readable detailed listing
* [ ] year summary: lectionary cycles, movable feasts
* [ ] configuration file to set default options
* [ ] specify calendar data path (with support for layering several calendars)
* [ ] option to auto-select one of optional celebrations - with multiple supported strategies (prefer ferial, take first non-ferial, configured whitelist, blacklist)
* [ ] integrate online data sources
* [ ] interactive browsing
